# Troubleshooting

## Engine Not Reachable

Symptoms:

- CLI errors connecting to `http://127.0.0.1:4041`

Checks:

- engine running with uvicorn
- `engine_addr` config value
- local firewall/network constraints

## Missing API Key

CLI run fails if provider key is missing.

Set one of:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## No Model Specified

`validtr run` requires `--model` — there is no default model. If you omit it the
CLI exits with "no model specified — pass --model".

## Model Not Found

A run failing with a model-not-found error (HTTP 400 from the engine) means the
model id is misspelled or **retired** by the provider. Use a current model id —
e.g. for Anthropic, `claude-sonnet-4-6` or `claude-opus-4-8`. (Older dated ids
such as `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` have been retired.)

## Docker Errors

Potential causes:

- Docker daemon not running
- insufficient permissions to Docker socket
- image build failures for base/per-run images

## Empty or Weak Recommendations

Potential causes:

- no `TAVILY_API_KEY` (web search skipped)
- upstream MCP/skills registry fetch failures
- provider JSON formatting failures

## Test Container Failures

Look for:

- malformed generated pytest
- test timeouts
- missing expected output files in `/workspace/output`

Runner output is included in `TestSuiteResult.runner_output`.
